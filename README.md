# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

This project serves the purpose of showcasing my work both inside and outside the bootcamp as my skills grow and improve! Right now, of course, it's not much but I do hope to add to it as time goes on and make the performance much better. For what it's worth, I was not able to satisfy all of the requirements unfortuneatly. I was unable to fully wrap my mind around the proper media query to successfully resize it. I got close, but it is definitely not perfect. I do, of course, intend on returning to the page to make it better soon. I did, however, learn a ton about the flexbox and the power it holds!
