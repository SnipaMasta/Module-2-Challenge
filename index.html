    <article><h1>About Christoper Rice</h1>
        <p>To start off my bio with a bang: I used to be <italic>fully</italic>ambidextrous! That's right, in Pre-K and Kindergarten I would begin writing with my left-hand and, when it got tired, I would hand the pencil off to my right! This skill also really came in handy when I got a bit older and started playing the drums! Anyway, now that I've broken the ice a bit, let's get to the boring stuff. </p>
        <p>I'm 24 years old and, in terms of a career, I've tried my hand at a handful of different things. At one time I waited tables at a saloon near my childhood home, I later assisted my father laying down ceramic tile, and I even attempted being an undead zombie at Six Flags: Great Adventure! Clearly, I love to try everything I possibly can! Rounding out my accomplishments, I also have a BA in Communication from Seton Hall University in South Orange, NJ.</p>
        <p>For fun, I love to play videogames on PS5 and, occasionally, stream that on Twitch. Some of my favorite games on the platform include the <italic>Uncharted</italic>Series, the<italic>Batman Arkham</italic>games, and Insomniac's Spider-Man to name a few! In addition, I often find myself creating hats with my girlfriend's company logo on them. When I feeling like punishing myself I watch my favorite New York teams, including the Giants and Yankees, lose. Finally, somewhere in between all of that, you can find me at the computer trying my hardest to learn and practice coding!</p>
