                <h1>About Christoper Rice</h1>
                <p> To start off my bio with a bang: I used to be fully ambidextrous! That's right, in Pre-K and
                    Kindergarten I would begin writing with my left-hand and, when it got tired, I would hand the pencil
                    off to my right! This skill also really came in handy when I got a bit older and started playing the
                    drums! Anyway, now that I've broken the ice a bit, let's get to the boring stuff. </p>
                <p> I'm 24 years old and, in terms of a career, I've tried my hand at a handful of different things. At
                    one time I waited tables at a saloon near my childhood home, I later assisted my father laying down
                    ceramic tile, and I even attempted being an undead zombie at Six Flags: Great Adventure! Clearly, I
                    love to try everything I possibly can! Rounding out my accomplishments, I also have a BA in
                    Communication from Seton Hall University in South Orange, NJ.</p>
                <p> For fun, I love to play videogames on PS5 and, occasionally, stream that on Twitch. Some of my
                    favorite games on the platform include the Uncharted Series, the Batman Arkham games, and
                    Insomniac's Spider-Man to name a few! In addition, I often find myself creating hats with my
                    girlfriend's company logo on them. When I'm feeling like punishing myself I watch my favorite New York
                    teams, including the Giants and Yankees, lose. Finally, somewhere in between all of that, you can
                    find me at the computer trying my hardest to learn and practice coding!</p>
